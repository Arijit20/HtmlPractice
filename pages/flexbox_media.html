              <p>After constructing close to the sea, resorts are facing its wrath. Debasis Shyamal,
                   district member of the National Fish Workers Forum, recounts a 2010 incident when 
                   the high tide washed away a toilet and a sea-facing hotel room. Several resorts had 
                   their ground-floor rooms and front constructions washed away, he says. To dissipate 
                   the force of waves, the resorts are now building giant concrete walls and lining it 
                   with boulders. “Constructing walls might offer temporary protection but it will 
                   destroy the beach,” says Shyamal. “One has to let the sea water travel as far as 
                   it wants. The water loses its force and recedes, leaving the sand behind. With walls,
                    the water rebounds and takes away sand by digging into the surface. This causes more erosion.”

                  <p>Biswas of the Hoteliers Welfare Association suggests,
                       “The state should speed up construction of the road to approach the resorts. 
                       Nearly all hotels are using the beach to ply tourists and supplies.” Referring 
                       to the damage done to the beach, a senior officer of the state environment department 
                       calls Mandarmani “murder on the orient express. Tourists will be sitting ducks if a 
                       cyclone hits the area”.</p>
